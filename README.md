phraseBasedDecoder
==================
Implementation of a phrase based decoder as part of fourth homework in [NLP course](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~anoop/teaching/CMPT-825-Fall-2012/index.html) by [Dr. Anoop Sarkar](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~anoop/). 
More details can be found [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15298710/hw4.pdf).

Note:- Language model path is hard coded in decoder.py. If you want to run it on local machine, you need to fix that.
